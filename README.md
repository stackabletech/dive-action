dive action is an action that allows developers who develop Docker image to run [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) on GitHub Actions. dive is a tool for exploring a docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink the size of your Docker/OCI image. Integrating dive into your CI will let you reduce your container image size as early as possible.

## **Usage**

### Inputs

| Name         | Type    | Required | Default              | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------|---------|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| config-file  | String  | false    |                      | Path to [dive config file](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive#ci-integration)                  |
| dive-image   | false   | true     | wagoodman/dive:v0.11 | The Docker image to use for dive                                                              |
| github-token | String  | false    |                      | GitHub token to post PR comment on dive failure                                               |
| image        | String  | true     |                      | Image to analyze                                                                              |
| report-only  | Boolean | false    | true                 | Whether to just report the results without failing the build (needs `github-token` to be set) |


### Workflow

```yaml
name: "Dive CI"

on: [push]

jobs:
  dive:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Analyze image efficiency
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build image
        run: docker build -t sample:latest .
      - name: Dive
        uses: stackabletech/dive-action@0.0.1
        with:
          image: "sample:latest"
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Config file

There are three metrics supported by dive config file. See [here](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive#ci-integration) for details.

```yaml
rules:
  # If the efficiency is measured below X%, mark as failed.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1.
  lowestEfficiency: 0.95

  # If the amount of wasted space is at least X or larger than X, mark as failed.
  # Expressed in B, KB, MB, and GB.
  highestWastedBytes: 20MB

  # If the amount of wasted space makes up for X% or more of the image, mark as failed.
  # Note: the base image layer is NOT included in the total image size.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1; fails if the threshold is met or crossed.
  highestUserWastedPercent: 0.20
```
